/**The C4Shape class implements a modifiable view that handles shapes. You can use this class to create almost any kind of basic shape, as well as more complicated polygons.
 
 C4Shape is a subclass of C4Control and inherits all its gesture, animation and notification abilities.
 
 This is the class that you should use to construct and add any shapes to C4's canvas.
 
 In C4, the main role of C4Shape is to provide access to constructing and manipulating the appearance of shapes. Almost all properties of shapes are animatable. The main goal for a C4Shape is to provide interactivity while encapsulating all the methods that act on its underlying shape layer.
