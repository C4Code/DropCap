/* Filters
 For now I am leaving out the following filters:
 - affineTransform -> easy to put in at a later date, i don't want to bother with semantics of naming the filter method so that it's distinct from image.transform, and i'm lazy today
 - checkerBoardGenerator -> easy to put in at a later date, creating images isn't something i'm interested in atm
 - cicolorcube -> unnecessary for now
 - ciconstantcolorgenerator -> not interested in generators
 - cicrop -> not interested in dealing with cropping and resizing an image right now...
 - cigaussiangradient -> not interested in dealing with generators
 - cilineargradient -> not interested in dealing with generators
 - ciradialgradient -> not interested in dealing with generators
 - cistripesgenerator -> not interested in dealing with generators
 - civignette -> currently undocumented in the ios Core Image Filter Reference

/**This document describes the C4Image class. A C4Image object provides access for creating, showing, interacting and manipulating images. C4Image is a subclass of C4Control and so inherits its animation, gesture and notification abilities.
 
 C4Image also takes advantage of its underlying C4Layer to allow for filtering the content of an image. You can apply filters that affect only the image (e.g. hueAdjust, vibranceAdjust, etc.) or use another image as the background for a particular blend or composite filter (e.g. additionComposite:, overlayBlend:, etc). 
 
 When working with blends and composite methods, it is recommended that the images you use are of the same size.
