/**This document describes the C4EAGLES1Renderer class, which is the default rendering class to use when working with OpenGL ES 1.x
 
 This class represents a rendering object which allows you to work with OpenGL ES 1.x, and provides simple functionality for setting up and rendering.
 
 This class has a simple interface, which includes a render and setup method.
 
 @warning You should never have to use this object directly. Instead, you should work with your own subclasses of [C4GL1Renderer](C4GL1Renderer) which hides some of the more complicated setup and teardown functionality available in this class.
