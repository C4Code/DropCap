/** C4Gesture protocol groups methods that are fundamental to basic interaction with all C4 objects which have a visible, on-screen presence.
 
 If an object conforms to this protocol, it can be considered as an interactive object which can respond to gestures.
 
 The C4 Framework is built with the idea that all visible objects have the ability to be interactive. In doing so, all visible objects will be subclasses of C4Control. Furthermore, because C4Control implements the C4Gesture protocol, all visible objects within C4 also conform to the methods defined below. 
 
 @warning *Note:* It is assumed that the object which includes this protocol is a subclass of [UIView](UIView).

/// @name Gesture Methods
/** Adds a gesture to an object.
 
 From the input parameters, this method constructs a gesture recognizer and adds it to the object from which it was called.
 
 Internally, this method creates a UIGestureRecognizer which it then uses as the main parameter when calling addGestureRecognizer:
  
 @param type defines the type of gesture that will be added, should be one of C4GestureType (e.g. TAP, PINCH, SWIPERIGHT, SWIPELEFT, SWIPEUP, SWIPEDOWN, ROTATION, PAN, LONGPRESS).
 @param gestureName a string (can be anything) which identifies the current gesture, so that it can be accessed later on.
 @param methodName a string which represents the name of a method defined in the object's class or any of its superclasses, this parameter should be written as a string (e.g. @"test", @"changePosition:")
 
 @warning *Note:* The methods being called by this object should take either no messages (e.g. -(void)test {}) or a single message defined as (id)sender (e.g. -(void)move:(id)sender {}). 
 
 In the case of a method such as aMethod:(id)sender it is assumed that the sender object is of the type UIGestureRecognizer or any of its subclasses. From this assumption it is safe to assume that the sender can be cast to the appropriate type, such as UIPanGestureRecognizer depending on the original C4GestureType specified in the _type_ parameter.
