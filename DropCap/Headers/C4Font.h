/** This document describes the C4Font class which provides basic font construction and manipulation throughout the C4 framework.

 The C4Font provides access to an underlying UIFont object, which class provides the interface for getting and setting font information. The class provides you with access to the font’s characteristics and also provides the system with access to the font’s glyph information, which is used during layout. You use font objects by passing them to methods that accept them as a parameter.
 
 You do not create C4Font objects using the alloc and init methods. Instead, you use class methods of C4Font to look up and retrieve the desired font object.
